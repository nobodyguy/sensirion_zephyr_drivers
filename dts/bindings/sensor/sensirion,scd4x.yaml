description: Sensirion SCD4x co2, humidity, and temperature sensor

compatible: "sensirion,scd4x"

include: i2c-device.yaml

properties:
  model:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      The sensor model in use
    enum:
        - "scd40"
        - "scd41"
  measure-mode:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Normal: Background measurement produces a new sample every 5 seconds

      Low power mode (SCD41 only): Similar to normal mode, sensor uses 3mA
      rather than 13-18mA. Produces a new sample every 30 seconds.

      Single-shot mode (SCD41 only): Similar to low-power mode but samples immediately
      after sensor_sample_fetch() is called. See option single-shot-power-down to put 
      sensor to sleep between samples.
    enum:
        - "normal"
        - "low-power"
        - "single-shot"
  single-shot-power-down:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
       Will send the power_down command to the sensor after a measurement, and wake it up again
       before the next measurement. Only works on SCD41 model.
  auto-calibration:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
       Recalibrates the sensor's 400ppm reference level to match lowest CO2 level seen in
       past 7 days (assumed to be outdoor air). Disable if the sensor is never exposed to
       outdoor air to avoid severe accuracy drift.
  temperature-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    default: 4
    description: |
      Degrees centigrade. Sensor subtracts this from temperature before calculating
      humidity. Does not affect CO2 sample. Use when sensor is inside a device that
      is hotter than ambient temperature.
  altitude:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      Meters above sea level, improves CO2 accuracy. Sensor uses it to calculate
      ambient pressure.

      The sensirion_scd4x_set_ambient_pressure() function in the driver can be called at any
      time to update the sensor calculations, which will override the altitude setting.
